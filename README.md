# digit-recognition

This project was realized by Elior Papiernik & Tom Winandy in the context of the course CS-107. 

The goal of this project was to implement and evaluate a program capable of recognizing handwritten numbers. To achieve our objective, we used a basic machine learning algorithm: KNN.
