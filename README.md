# digit-recognition

This project was realized by Elior Papiernik & Tom Winandy in the context of the course CS-107. 

The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate a program capable of recognizing handwritten numbers. 
This computer vision task has many practical applications, the most important of which is probably the digitization of documents. It can easily be generalized to recognize characters other than numbers.
To achieve our objective, we will use a machine learning algorithm: instead of explaining to the computer how to recognize numbers through rules (conditional if / else statements), we will show it a large collection of images of handwritten numbers indicating, for each image, to which number it corresponds. This will allow the program to subsequently process and interpret new images of handwritten numbers.
